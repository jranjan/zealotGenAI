# Parameter Tuning Guide

### Parameter Reference Table

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Top-K** | Defines a fixed shortlist of the most likely tokens, preventing the model from wandering too far into low-probability options |
| **Top-P (Nucleus Sampling)** | Creates a probability-based shortlist that adapts dynamically to context, ensuring the model considers just enough options to stay fluent while remaining flexible |
| **Temperature** | Controls the randomness of selection, tuning whether the model plays it safe (low temperature) or experiments more freely (high temperature) |
| **Frequency Penalty** | Helps avoid redundancy by discouraging the model from repeating the same words too often |
| **Presence Penalty** | Pushes for novelty, encouraging the model to introduce words or ideas that haven't appeared yet in the text |

### Parameter Tuning Ranges

| Parameter | Range | Effect | Recommendation |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Temperature** | 0.0-0.3 | Very focused, deterministic responses | For precise, factual content |
| | 0.4-0.7 | Balanced creativity and coherence | **Recommended for most use cases** |
| | 0.8-1.2 | More creative and varied responses | For creative writing |
| | 1.3-2.0 | Highly creative, potentially less coherent | For experimental content |
| **Top-K** | 1-10 | Very focused, conservative responses | For deterministic outputs |
| | 20-40 | Balanced selection | **Recommended default** |
| | 50-100 | More diverse, potentially less coherent | For creative exploration |
| **Top-P (Nucleus Sampling)** | 0.1-0.3 | Very focused responses | For precise, narrow outputs |
| | 0.7-0.9 | Balanced creativity | **Recommended for most cases** |
| | 0.9-1.0 | Maximum diversity | For maximum creativity |
| **Penalty Parameters** | Negative values | Encourage repetition/avoid novelty | Rarely used |
| | 0.0 | No penalty (neutral) | **Default setting** |
| | Positive values | Reduce repetition/encourage novelty | For varied content |


### Parameter Combination Strategies

| Outcome | Potential Combination | Description | Example Use Case |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Conservative & Accurate** | Low Temperature (0.1‚Äì0.3), Small Top-K (‚â§20), No penalties | Model picks only from safest options. Predictable, focused, minimal risk of nonsense. | Step-by-step math solutions, legal contracts, medical instructions |
| **Balanced Assistant** | Medium Temperature (0.7‚Äì1.0), Top-P ~0.9, Mild penalties | Natural mix of predictability and creativity. Can adapt across domains without drifting. | General-purpose chatbot, customer support, Q&A with light variation |
| **Creative & Diverse** | High Temperature (1.2‚Äì1.8), Large Top-K (‚â•100), Presence Penalty (0.5‚Äì0.8) | Model explores unusual options, introduces new ideas, avoids repetition. | Storytelling, brainstorming, poetry, marketing slogans |
| **Structured but Flexible** | Medium Temperature (~0.7), Top-P 0.8, Small Frequency Penalty (0.2‚Äì0.4) | Ensures logical flow while reducing repeated phrases. | Technical documentation, product descriptions, long-form essays |
| **Exploratory / Idea Generator** | Temperature 1.0‚Äì1.5, Top-P ~0.95, Higher Presence Penalty (0.6‚Äì1.0) | Strong push for novelty ‚Äî encourages out-of-the-box concepts. | Research ideation, design thinking sessions, new feature suggestions |
| **Highly Deterministic** | Temperature = 0, Top-K = 1 | Model always picks the top choice. Fully reproducible, zero randomness. | Unit test generation, deterministic query responses |
| **Conversational Naturalness** | Temperature 0.7‚Äì0.9, Top-P ~0.9, Mild Frequency Penalty (0.3‚Äì0.5) | Sounds like a human ‚Äî avoids exact repetition but still flows smoothly. | Dialogue systems, teaching assistants, personal companions |
| **Safe & Guarded** | Low Temp (0.2‚Äì0.5), Top-P 0.7‚Äì0.8, No penalties | Model sticks to mainstream, cautious answers. | Compliance-focused chatbots, corporate communications |

### System Prompt Templates

Predefined AI behavior templates that set the tone, style, and expertise level for responses across professional, technical, friendly, and creative use cases.

The app includes predefined system prompt templates to guide the AI's behavior and response style. Choose from 15 different templates across 4 categories:

| Category | Template | Description | Best For |

| **Friendly / Casual** | Friendly Assistant | Simple explanations with relatable examples | General help, casual conversations |
| | Educational Tutor | Patient explanations for learners | Teaching, educational content |
| | Concise Advisor | Short, clear, actionable answers | Quick help, brief responses |
| **Creative / Imaginative** | Storyteller | Imaginative narratives with vivid descriptions | Creative writing, storytelling |

| | Brainstorming Partner | Multiple creative ideas and solutions | Ideation, problem-solving, innovation |
| | Persona-based Roleplay | Consistent character responses | Roleplay, character interactions |

**Usage Tips:**
- Select "Custom" to write your own system prompt
- Combine system prompts with appropriate parameter settings
- Professional prompts work well with lower temperature (0.3-0.7)
- Creative prompts benefit from higher temperature (0.8-1.2)
